CT Image Analysis for Porosity and Calcite Calculation  
======================================================  

Overview:  
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for analyzing CT images to determine porosity and calcite volume fraction. These scripts process a sequence of CT scan images to quantify pore space and mineral precipitation.  

Files and Functionality:  

1. **Porosity_Calculation.m**  
   - Author: Abdullah Al Nahian (April 2022)  
   - Purpose: Calculates porosity by analyzing CT scan images.  
   - Function:  
     - Loads a sequence of .tif images from a specified folder.  
     - Identifies pores (black pixels) and grains (white pixels).  
     - Computes porosity as the ratio of pore pixels to total pixels.  
     - Creates a 3D matrix of the image data for further analysis.  
   - Usage:  
     - Update the `dirName` variable with the folder path containing CT images.  
     - Run the script in MATLAB.  
     - The calculated porosity value will be displayed.  

2. **Calcite_Fraction_Calculation.m**  
   - Author: Abdullah Al Nahian (December 2023)  
   - Purpose: Determines the calcite volume fraction from CT images.  
   - Function:  
     - Loads .tif images from a given folder.  
     - Identifies calcite pixels and separates them from pore space.  
     - Computes calcite volume fraction for each image slice.  
     - Saves results in `Calcitefraction.txt`, listing:  
       - Slice number  
       - Total pore pixels  
       - Total calcite pixels  
       - Calcite fraction (%)  
   - Usage:  
     - Update the folder path in `jpeg1 = dir('write_the_imagefile_location\*.tif');`.  
     - Run the script in MATLAB.  
     - The output file `Calcitefraction.txt` will contain the results.
